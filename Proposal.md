\#Title: Penelope Final Project

\#Repository: [https://github.com/Pendepau/Penelope\_FinalProject](https://github.com/Pendepau/Penelope_FinalProject) 

\#Description

- My program will create a 2-D platformer that has a playable character, sidescrolling mechanics, and a death screen. 

\#Features:  
\#\#Character will be created using a class with many functions to have them move  

\#\#I currently have no idea how I would implement a sliding screen  

\#\#Death screen will be a counter that goes down and once it hits zero the screen will appear  

\#Challenges:   
\#\#Like stated earlier I don’t know how to add a sidescroller and I will have to research into how to add it

\#Outcomes:  
\#\#Ideal Outcome:  
\#\#\# I will be able to add all of my basic features and add more on top of it
\#\#Minimal Outcome:  

\#\#\# I will only have the three features however they will work as intended

\#Milestones:  
\#\#Week 1  
\#\#\#Basic environment   
\#\#\#Playable character  

\#\#Week 2  
\#\#\#Sidescrolling mechanic  
\#\#\#Death screen  

\#\#Week 3
